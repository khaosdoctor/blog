# Design

Nothing here is applied yet beyond the tokens. This is the plan and the shortlist, kept short on purpose.

## Direction

ASCII/ANSI, 8-bit, pixelated, terminal. Box drawing instead of borders where it reads well, uppercase labels,
section markers like `SECTION 00 / INDEX`, dashed rules, information dense over decorated.

References: [unix.foo](https://unix.foo), [xn--gckvb8fzb.com](https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/),
[tramoia.sh](https://tramoia.sh). Text animation via [textmode.js](https://code.textmode.art), WebGL2 to a canvas,
zero dependencies, so it bundles locally and needs no CSP change.

The same treatment covers the generated images: post covers, OG cards and any background art share the palette and
the pixel grid, so a share card looks like the site.

## Tokens

All of them live in `src/styles/theme.css`. Components reference roles (`--fg`, `--accent`, `--rule`), never the
brand hexes, and nothing else in the codebase hardcodes a colour, a font stack, a radius or a duration.

Palette, traced from the favicon: red `#e30613`, green `#45b384`, yellow `#f5b200`, blue `#0578be`. Those stay.
`--radius: 0` by default, because rounded corners fight a pixel grid.

## Fonts

Two stacks on purpose. A pixel face is right for chrome, labels and headings and punishing for a 3000 word article,
so `--font-body` stays readable and `--font-display` is where the 8-bit face goes. All candidates below are free and
self-hosted (CSP is `font-src 'self'`).

| Face | Licence | Good for | Watch out |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Departure Mono](https://departuremono.com) | OFL | display, chrome, code | lowercase x-height is small at body sizes |
| [Silkscreen](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Silkscreen) | OFL | tiny labels, badges | uppercase only in practice, no italics |
| [Pixelify Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pixelify+Sans) | OFL | headings with more weight | four weights, no mono |
| [PxPlus IBM VGA8](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/) | CC BY-SA 4.0 | authentic DOS terminal | share-alike plus attribution, bitmap so it only looks right at exact multiples |
| [IBM Plex Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono) | OFL | body and code if a pixel face is too much | not pixelated, blocky rather than 8-bit |

Rendering: `image-rendering: pixelated` on raster art, and bitmap faces only at whole-pixel sizes or they blur.

## Icons

SVG only, no raster. Inline them in the component that uses them so they inherit `currentColor` and cost no request;
a sprite sheet only if the same icon appears on many pages.

Shortlist, all free: [Pixelarticons](https://pixelarticons.com) (MIT, 480 icons, drawn on a 24px grid, the closest
match to the direction), [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) (ISC, huge, clean, not pixelated),
[Feather](https://feathericons.com) (MIT, smaller and older). Box drawing characters cover rules, corners and
brackets without any icon at all.

Keep whatever we adopt in `src/components/icons/` as one small `.astro` per icon, and only the ones actually used.

## Open decisions

- Display face, and whether body copy goes mono too.
- Cover and OG layout: flat brand background or generated art, what the card carries besides the title, how a
  90 character title behaves. Covers are per locale, `cover.pt.png` and `cover.en.png`, since the title is baked in.
- Whether the theme toggle becomes explicit. Today it is native `light-dark()` with no JS and no stored preference.
- Where the reader settings live once there is a footer, starting with the pinned-preview persistence checkbox.
